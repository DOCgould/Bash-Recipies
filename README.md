# Bash-Recipies
>A Number of Useful Bash Recipies for Various Projects and applications

There are a great number of bash scripts that I make on the daily basis that would be great to use consistently - yet I often forget them once they're done. 
So I plan on filling this repo with bash scripts that I use to make my projects for easy quick 'n dirty templates.

# generate-project.sh
This script is a quick way to make a template CMAKE project directory - with an automatically generated CMakeLists.txt Ideally with pre-filled `MACRO` and `FUNCTION` definitions.
*this still needs to be filled out* so once that's done Ill ideally update this script.
